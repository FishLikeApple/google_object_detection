This project is based on the famous dataset [Open Images V5](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/download.html), and is for [Open Images Challenge 2019](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/challenge2019.html). A powerful state-of-art structure [DCN](https://github.com/FishLikeApple/mmdetection/tree/master/configs/dcn) is used with a custom loss.  
Note that this project is combined with https://github.com/FishLikeApple/mmdetection, and since mmdetection was modified for this project, files in to_mmdetection need to be in right places in mmdetection to replace corresponding original files before running.
